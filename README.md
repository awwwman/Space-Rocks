## what i did on my own:
* i changed the sprites and took a different art direction from the tutorial
* used different movement style for ship where it's more snappy and responsive
* made it so asteroids can bounce off of each other when they collide
* added some sort of power-up whenever the player gains a satisfying amount of scores for an amount of time
* added dashing and some visual flair to it (motion trail)
* asteroids spawn on their own infinitely until the player runs out of ships
* added a visual indicator to show that the player has been damaged 
* lowered bullet range so the ship doesn't snipe asteroids outside of the screen
