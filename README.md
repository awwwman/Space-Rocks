# space rocks

> I followed this particular series of tutorials (PT. 1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIc8Kon5PFw

## what i did:
- [x] completed part 1
- [x] completed part 2
- [x] completed part 3
- [x] completed part 4
- [x] completed part 5
- [x] completed camera mods

## what i did on my own:
* i changed the sprites and took a different art direction from the tutorial
* made it so asteroids can bounce off of each other when they collide
* added some sort of power-up whenever the player gains a satisfying amount of scores for an amount of time
* added dashing and some visual flair to it (motion trail)
* asteroids spawn on their own infinitely until the player runs out of ships
* added a visual indicator to show that the player has been damaged
